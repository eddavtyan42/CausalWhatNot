\begin{abstract}
This thesis investigates how reliably commonly used causal discovery algorithms recover known
causal structures from synthetic data generated from accepted benchmark networks.  It also
explores how mis--specification of an analyst's directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be detected
through data--driven checks, and surveys open--source tools available for constructing and
validating causal graphs.  We develop a reproducible benchmarking framework that runs PC,
GES, NOTEARS and COSMO on the Asia, Sachs, ALARM and Child networks, computing
precision, recall, $F_1$ and structural Hamming distance (SHD).  We then design controlled
scenarios where a human analyst omits a true causal link or adds a spurious edge and show
how conditional independence tests and bootstrap stability metrics can notify the analyst of
such errors.  Finally, we provide practitioner guidance on building and checking causal
diagrams using contemporary software and algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
Causal diagrams—directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that encode cause--effect relationships
between variables—are indispensable for reasoning about interventions and policy decisions.
They consist of nodes representing variables and directed edges denoting direct causal effects.
A graph qualifies as a DAG if no node can reach itself by following directed edges and if all
variables that are common causes of any two nodes are included.
When domain experts draw such diagrams incorrectly, downstream causal inference and
decision making are compromised.  As Prof.~Jolkver noted in feedback on our proposal, the
greatest practical hurdle in causal inference is that ``you seldomly can be sure on the factors
and their relationships'' (personal correspondence).

This thesis pursues three goals.  First, we benchmark multiple structure--learning
methods—PC, GES, NOTEARS and COSMO—on established toy networks to evaluate how
well they recover known causal structures.  The standardized framework ensures that
comparisons are meaningful by using shared metrics and reproducible implementations.
Second, we study how analyst mis--specification propagates: if a practitioner erroneously
removes an edge or inserts a spurious link, can the data alert them?  We design controlled
experiments where the true DAG generates data but the analyst's DAG deviates from it.
Third, we survey open--source tools for drawing and testing DAGs to provide practical
guidance on constructing and validating causal diagrams.

The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows.  Section~\ref{sec:background}
reviews the basics of causal DAGs, conditional independence (CI) and common
structure--learning algorithms.  Section~\ref{sec:related} summarises related work on
benchmarking causal discovery, mis--specification detection and DAG drawing software.
Section~\ref{sec:methods} describes our datasets, data generation procedures, algorithms,
metrics and mis--specification protocols.  Section~\ref{sec:results} presents benchmark and
sensitivity results.  Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses practical implications, limitations
and recommendations for practitioners.  Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Causal DAGs and Conditional Independence}
A DAG consists of nodes $V$ and directed edges $E$ such that there are no directed cycles.
When interpreted causally, each edge represents a direct causal effect.  DAGs imply a set of
conditional independence (CI) relations via the d--separation criterion: if two nodes are
 d--separated by a set of conditioning variables, then they should be independent in any
 distribution compatible with the DAG.  Conversely, dependence relationships in data that
 contradict these CI implications indicate misspecification.  The DAGitty cheat sheet
 emphasises that the diagnostic panel lists testable implications—relationships that should be
 absent if the model is correct—and suggests that if, upon adjusting for certain variables,
 two variables remain dependent in the data then ``you’d know the model was wrong''.
 This principle underlies our mis--specification checks.  The foundational work of
 Pearl formalised the use of directed acyclic graphs for causal reasoning and introduced the
 d--separation rules and the causal Markov and faithfulness assumptions.

\subsection{Structure--Learning Algorithms}
We briefly summarise the four algorithms evaluated.  PC (Peter--Clarke) is a
 constraint--based algorithm that uses CI tests to remove edges and orient them according to
 v--structures and Meek's rules.  Its theoretical foundations trace back to the work of
 Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines on causal discovery.  GES (Greedy
 Equivalence Search) is a score--based method that searches over equivalence classes of
 DAGs to maximise a penalised likelihood score; Chickering proved its asymptotic
 optimality.  NOTEARS formulates structure learning as a continuous
 optimisation problem with an acyclicity constraint.  COSMO
 (Constrained Orientations by Sequential M Operation) is a regression--based approach
 that prioritises adding edges compatible with a topological ordering.
 All four algorithms are integrated in the \emph{CausalWhatNot} framework and are run
 with comparable settings to facilitate fair comparison.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To quantify how well a learned graph $\hat{G}$ matches the true graph $G$, we compute
 precision (fraction of predicted edges in $\hat{G}$ that appear in $G$), recall
 (fraction of edges in $G$ recovered) and the harmonic mean $F_1$.  Structural Hamming
 distance (SHD) counts the number of edge insertions, deletions and reversals needed to
 transform $\hat{G}$ into $G$.  When \emph{orientation\_metrics} are enabled, directed
 precision and recall treat edge directions as essential.  When bootstrapping,
 we report means and standard deviations across runs.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Causal discovery has a rich theoretical and empirical literature.  In this section we
 summarise key foundations, benchmark studies, methods for detecting mis--specification,
 software tools, and recent algorithmic advances.

\subsection{Foundational Theories of Causal Discovery}
Graphical causal models were pioneered by Judea Pearl, who introduced directed acyclic
 graphs as a formal language for encoding causal assumptions and developed the
 d--separation criterion and do--calculus.  The monograph by Spirtes,
 Glymour and Scheines systematised constraint--based structure learning, leading to the PC
 algorithm.  Chickering later proved that greedy score--based search can
 identify the optimal network structure under certain regularity conditions.
 Glymour et~al. provide a modern survey of graphical causal discovery methods and their
 assumptions.

\subsection{Benchmarking Causal Discovery Algorithms}
Comparative evaluations of structure--learning algorithms have been conducted on both
 synthetic and real networks.  Scutari, Graafland and Guti\'errez benchmarked a range
 of constraint--based (PC--family), score--based (GES, hill--climbing) and hybrid methods
 across multiple datasets and concluded that no single algorithm dominates across all
 conditions.  They found that MMHC, a hybrid approach combining
 constraint and score heuristics, often achieves the best trade--off between accuracy and
 speed.  Reisach, Seiler and Weichwald warned that popular simulated DAG
 generators produce ``too easy'' data where node variances grow along the causal order,
 allowing simple baselines to recover much of the structure.  They advocate
 the use of more challenging semi--synthetic benchmarks.  Using canonical networks such as
 Asia, ALARM, Child and Sachs has become standard practice for evaluating causal
 discovery algorithms, and we adopt these datasets in our study.

\subsection{Mis--specification Detection and Model Validation}
Validating a user--specified DAG involves testing whether the conditional independencies
 it implies hold in the data.  DAGitty implements functions for local tests of each implied
 independence and highlights violations.  Ankan et~al. demonstrated
 how such diagnostic tests can pinpoint missing or spurious edges: a single significant
 violation suggests that the analyst should revise the graph.  Friedman
 and colleagues introduced the use of the bootstrap to estimate edge stability; repeated
 sampling and re--learning yields an empirical inclusion probability for each edge.
 Scutari and Nagarajan formalised this idea and proposed significance thresholds to
 distinguish robust from spurious arcs.  These techniques collectively provide
 a toolkit for model criticism beyond simple goodness--of--fit scores.

\subsection{Software Tools for Causal DAG Analysis}
Numerous open--source libraries exist for drawing and analysing DAGs.  DAGitty offers a
 browser--based interface and an R package to create graphs, identify adjustment sets and
 test implied independencies.  The bnlearn package implements many
 structure--learning algorithms and supports bootstrap strength estimation.
 pcalg focuses on constraint--based methods such as PC and FCI and provides efficient
 implementations of CI tests.  The Causal Discovery Toolbox (CDT)
 collects a large set of algorithms (including time--series methods and GAN--based
 techniques) under a unified Python API.  Tetrad remains a widely
 used graphical environment with interactive workflows for combining algorithms and
 incorporating expert knowledge.  More recently, causal--learn offers a
 modern Python implementation of many classic and cutting--edge algorithms with clear
 interfaces and documentation.

\subsection{Recent Advances in Structure Learning Algorithms}
The field has advanced beyond classic PC and GES to include order--independent
 constraint variants and differentiable frameworks.  PC--Stable eliminates order
 dependence in the PC algorithm by symmetrising the adjacency search.
 MMHC combines local constraint heuristics with hill--climb search and has been shown to
 outperform pure constraint or score--based methods in large benchmarks.
 LiNGAM extends causal discovery to linear models with non--Gaussian noise and proves
 identifiability from purely observational data.  Continuous optimisation
 approaches, beginning with NOTEARS, recast DAG learning as solving a smooth
 constrained optimisation problem.  GOLEM simplifies this by removing
 explicit acyclicity penalties.  Recent work uses neural networks to model
 nonlinear causal relationships: GraN--DAG learns directed graphs by optimising over
 neural network weights, while reinforcement learning agents have also been
 applied to DAG search.  Massidda et~al. propose COSMO, which enforces
 acyclicity through a smooth orientation function and scales quadratically with the number
 of nodes.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Datasets and Data Generation}
Our experiments use four canonical networks summarised in Table~\ref{tab:datasets}.
 Following \emph{CausalWhatNot}, each dataset is programmatically generated to avoid
 storing large files.  For each network we sample $n$
 observations from the joint distribution defined by the DAG and simulate observational
 data by drawing noise from appropriate distributions (Bernoulli for binary variables,
 Gaussian for continuous variables).  We treat Asia, ALARM and Child as discrete
 datasets and Sachs as continuous.  Generation scripts ensure reproducible sampling with
 fixed random seeds.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Summary of benchmark networks.  The domains and number of
   variables are taken from the \emph{CausalWhatNot} documentation.}
  \label{tab:datasets}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Variables} & \textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Notes}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & 8 & medical diagnostic toy example & Binary variables\\
    Sachs & 11 & protein signalling & Continuous\\
    ALARM & 37 & medical monitoring & Discretised\\
    Child & 20 & paediatric diagnosis & Discretised\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Algorithms and Settings}
We run four algorithms via the \emph{CausalWhatNot} framework.  PC and GES are
 implemented using the causal--learn package.  NOTEARS uses the CausalNex
 implementation and is restricted to Python~3.10 because CausalNex depends on
 PyTorch.  COSMO is implemented using numpy and
 networkx.  For fair comparison we generate data with the same sample size per
 dataset, run each algorithm with a time--out of 30~s, and use bootstrap sampling to
 estimate mean performance metrics.  When the data appears discrete (integer--valued
 columns with limited states), PC automatically uses a chi--square CI test and GES uses
 the BDeu score.  These default behaviours can be overridden but we
 retain them to follow recommended practice.

\subsection{Mis--specification Protocols}
To study analyst mis--specification, we consider two scenarios for each network:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Missing edge}: the analyst's DAG omits a true causal link, e.g. removing
     Tuberculosis$\to$Either in the Asia network.  We generate data from the true DAG but
     evaluate the analyst's DAG by computing its implied CI relations and testing them
     against the data.  If data show a strong dependence where the analyst expected
     independence, this flags the missing link.  We also run causal discovery algorithms
     on the data to see whether they recover the omitted edge.
  \item \textbf{Spurious edge}: the analyst adds a non--existent link, e.g. adding
     VisitAsia$\to$Dyspnea.  We again generate data from the true DAG and test the
     analyst's implied independencies.  Finding that two variables remain independent
     after conditioning suggests that the extra edge is unnecessary.  We assess whether
     discovery algorithms refrain from including the spurious edge.
\end{enumerate}
For both scenarios we vary the sample size to examine how detection depends on data
 volume.  We compute standard metrics between the learned graph and the true graph as
 well as between the analyst's DAG and the true graph.  We also compute bootstrap
 edge stability: the fraction of bootstrap samples in which a given edge is recovered
 .  Low stability may indicate spurious edges.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the empirical findings from our benchmarking experiments.  We first
examine the overall performance of the four algorithms across the five benchmark networks,
then analyse the challenges of edge orientation, explore algorithm--data interactions, and
finally report results from our mis--specification detection experiments.

\subsection{Benchmark Performance Overview}

Table~\ref{tab:skeleton_results} summarises the skeleton recovery performance of each
algorithm across all datasets.  Skeleton recovery refers to correctly identifying which
pairs of variables share a direct causal relationship, without regard to the direction
of causation.  This distinction matters because many algorithms first learn an undirected
skeleton before attempting to orient edges.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Skeleton recovery performance.  Precision, recall and $F_1$ treat edges as
   undirected.  Bold indicates the best $F_1$ score for each dataset.}
  \label{tab:skeleton_results}
  \begin{tabular}{llcccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{$F_1$} & \textbf{SHD}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & PC & 0.73 & 1.00 & 0.84 & 8\\
         & GES & 0.57 & 1.00 & 0.73 & 10\\
         & NOTEARS & \textbf{0.88} & 0.88 & \textbf{0.88} & 8\\
         & COSMO & 0.78 & 0.88 & 0.82 & 6\\
    \midrule
    Sachs & PC & 1.00 & 0.82 & 0.90 & 6\\
          & GES & 0.50 & 0.29 & 0.37 & 17\\
          & NOTEARS & \textbf{1.00} & \textbf{1.00} & \textbf{1.00} & 0\\
          & COSMO & 0.85 & 0.65 & 0.73 & 14\\
    \midrule
    Alarm & PC & 0.70 & 0.65 & \textbf{0.67} & 50\\
          & GES & 0.43 & 0.80 & 0.56 & 82\\
          & NOTEARS & 0.59 & 0.63 & 0.61 & 59\\
          & COSMO & 0.57 & 0.43 & 0.49 & 53\\
    \midrule
    Child & PC & 0.72 & 0.72 & \textbf{0.72} & 22\\
          & GES & 0.59 & 0.92 & 0.72 & 30\\
          & NOTEARS & 0.69 & 0.72 & 0.71 & 21\\
          & COSMO & 0.69 & 0.72 & 0.71 & 25\\
    \midrule
    Insurance & PC & 0.73 & 0.46 & 0.56 & 43\\
              & GES & 0.52 & 0.65 & \textbf{0.58} & 66\\
              & NOTEARS & 0.39 & 0.42 & 0.41 & 79\\
              & COSMO & 0.52 & 0.54 & 0.53 & 66\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Several patterns emerge from these results.  First, no single algorithm dominates across
all datasets.  NOTEARS achieves perfect recovery on Sachs ($F_1 = 1.00$), the only
continuous dataset, but performs relatively poorly on the larger discrete networks.  PC
tends to be the most consistent performer, achieving the highest or near--highest $F_1$ on
four of the five datasets.  GES shows high variability: it excels on Asia in the
sensitivity analysis but struggles on Sachs and produces many false positives on Alarm.

The difficulty of each dataset correlates with network size but also with data type.
Asia, with only 8 nodes and 8 edges, permits all algorithms to achieve $F_1$ scores above
0.70.  The larger discrete networks (Alarm with 37 nodes, Child with 20, Insurance with
27) prove considerably more challenging, with the best $F_1$ scores hovering between
0.56 and 0.72.  The structural Hamming distance (SHD) quantifies these difficulties more
directly: even the best--performing algorithm on Alarm commits 50 errors (edge insertions,
deletions or reversals), compared to only 6 on the smaller Sachs network.

Figure~\ref{fig:skeleton_f1} visualises these results.  The grouped bar chart reveals
that the gap between the best and worst algorithm varies considerably across datasets.
On Sachs, NOTEARS outperforms the next--best algorithm (PC) by 0.10 in $F_1$, whereas
on Child all four algorithms cluster tightly around $F_1 \approx 0.71$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/skeleton_f1_comparison.png}
  \caption{Skeleton $F_1$ scores by dataset and algorithm.  The dashed horizontal line
   indicates $F_1 = 0.50$, representing performance no better than a naive baseline.}
  \label{fig:skeleton_f1}
\end{figure}

The precision--recall trade--off, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:precision_recall}, provides
additional insight into algorithmic behaviour.  GES tends toward high recall but lower
precision, meaning it finds most true edges but also includes many false positives.  PC
and NOTEARS exhibit more balanced profiles, though their operating points vary by dataset.
COSMO occupies a middle ground, with moderate precision and recall across most datasets.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/precision_recall_tradeoff.png}
  \caption{Precision--recall scatter plot for skeleton recovery.  Each point represents
   one algorithm--dataset combination.  Dashed curves show iso--$F_1$ contours.}
  \label{fig:precision_recall}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Orientation Problem}

Recovering the skeleton represents only half the challenge of causal discovery.
Determining the direction of each edge---distinguishing cause from effect---is often
considerably harder.  Table~\ref{tab:directed_results} reports directed precision, recall
and $F_1$, which penalise reversed edges as errors.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Directed edge recovery performance.  Reversed edges count as errors.}
  \label{tab:directed_results}
  \begin{tabular}{llccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Dir.\ Precision} & \textbf{Dir.\ Recall} & \textbf{Dir.\ $F_1$}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & PC & 0.27 & 0.38 & 0.32\\
         & GES & 0.29 & 0.50 & 0.36\\
         & NOTEARS & 0.13 & 0.13 & 0.13\\
         & COSMO & \textbf{0.44} & \textbf{0.50} & \textbf{0.47}\\
    \midrule
    Sachs & PC & 0.79 & 0.65 & 0.71\\
          & GES & 0.50 & 0.29 & 0.37\\
          & NOTEARS & \textbf{1.00} & \textbf{1.00} & \textbf{1.00}\\
          & COSMO & 0.38 & 0.29 & 0.33\\
    \midrule
    Alarm & PC & 0.21 & 0.20 & 0.20\\
          & GES & 0.16 & 0.30 & \textbf{0.21}\\
          & NOTEARS & 0.14 & 0.15 & 0.15\\
          & COSMO & 0.23 & 0.17 & 0.20\\
    \midrule
    Child & PC & 0.40 & 0.40 & 0.40\\
          & GES & 0.28 & 0.44 & 0.34\\
          & NOTEARS & \textbf{0.46} & \textbf{0.48} & \textbf{0.47}\\
          & COSMO & 0.31 & 0.32 & 0.31\\
    \midrule
    Insurance & PC & \textbf{0.55} & \textbf{0.35} & \textbf{0.42}\\
              & GES & 0.27 & 0.35 & 0.31\\
              & NOTEARS & 0.13 & 0.13 & 0.13\\
              & COSMO & 0.22 & 0.23 & 0.23\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The gap between skeleton and directed $F_1$ is striking.  On Asia, for example, PC
achieves skeleton $F_1 = 0.84$ but directed $F_1 = 0.32$---a drop of over 50 percentage
points.  This pattern holds across most algorithm--dataset pairs.  Only NOTEARS on Sachs
maintains parity, achieving perfect directed recovery alongside perfect skeleton recovery.

Figure~\ref{fig:skeleton_vs_directed} illustrates this phenomenon.  Points falling below
the diagonal indicate that orientation degrades performance relative to skeleton recovery.
Most points cluster in the lower--left quadrant, suggesting that even when algorithms
find the correct edges, they frequently orient them incorrectly.  The lone exception is
NOTEARS on Sachs, which lies on the diagonal at the $(1.0, 1.0)$ corner.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/skeleton_vs_directed_f1.png}
  \caption{Skeleton $F_1$ versus directed $F_1$.  Points below the diagonal indicate
   orientation errors.  Dataset abbreviations: ASI = Asia, SAC = Sachs, ALA = Alarm,
   CHI = Child, INS = Insurance.}
  \label{fig:skeleton_vs_directed}
\end{figure}

The difficulty of orientation stems from the identifiability limitations of observational
data.  Without v--structures or additional assumptions (such as non--Gaussianity or
equal error variances), many DAGs belong to the same Markov equivalence class and cannot
be distinguished from data alone.  Our implementation converts the learned equivalence
class (a CPDAG) to a specific DAG using a heuristic that attempts to avoid cycles, but
the resulting orientation may differ from the true graph.

\subsection{Algorithm--Data Interactions}

The results reveal important interactions between algorithm design and data
characteristics.  We examine three aspects: data type (continuous vs.\ discrete),
network size, and computational cost.

\paragraph{Data Type Effects.}
NOTEARS was designed for continuous data under linear--Gaussian assumptions.  Its
exceptional performance on Sachs ($F_1 = 1.00$, SHD $= 0$) confirms that when these
assumptions hold, the algorithm can recover the true graph with remarkable accuracy.
However, on discrete data, NOTEARS struggles.  On Alarm, it achieves $F_1 = 0.61$ and
SHD $= 59$; on Insurance, performance drops further to $F_1 = 0.41$ and SHD $= 79$.
The linear model fundamentally mismatches the discrete data--generating process, leading
to spurious edges and incorrect orientations.

PC and GES, by contrast, adapt their conditional independence tests and scoring functions
to the data type.  PC uses a chi--square test for discrete data and Fisher's $z$--test
for continuous data.  GES switches between the BDeu score (for discrete) and BIC (for
continuous).  This flexibility allows both algorithms to maintain reasonable performance
across data types, though neither matches NOTEARS's continuous--data optimum.

COSMO, our regression--based approach, uses Lasso with stability selection.  It performs
respectably on both data types, achieving $F_1 = 0.82$ on Asia and $F_1 = 0.73$ on Sachs.
However, it struggles on the larger discrete networks, where the underlying linear model
again proves inadequate.

Figure~\ref{fig:datatype_performance} summarises these patterns.  The three--panel display
partitions datasets by type and size, revealing that algorithm rankings shift considerably
across conditions.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/performance_by_datatype.png}
  \caption{Algorithm performance by data characteristics.  Left: continuous data (Sachs).
   Centre: small discrete network (Asia).  Right: large discrete networks (average of
   Alarm, Child and Insurance).}
  \label{fig:datatype_performance}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Network Size Effects.}
Larger networks pose greater challenges for all algorithms.  The search space grows
super--exponentially with the number of nodes, and the number of conditional independence
relationships to test or edges to score increases correspondingly.  On Asia (8 nodes),
all algorithms achieve $F_1 \geq 0.73$.  On Alarm (37 nodes), the best $F_1$ is only 0.67,
and several algorithms fall below 0.50.  The SHD heatmap in Figure~\ref{fig:shd_heatmap}
visualises this scaling behaviour: errors accumulate rapidly as network complexity grows.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/shd_heatmap.png}
  \caption{Structural Hamming distance (SHD) across datasets and algorithms.  Lower
   values (lighter colours) indicate better performance.}
  \label{fig:shd_heatmap}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Computational Cost.}
Runtime varies dramatically across algorithms.  Table~\ref{tab:runtime} reports execution
times for each algorithm--dataset pair.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Runtime in seconds.  Bold indicates the fastest algorithm for each dataset.}
  \label{tab:runtime}
  \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{PC} & \textbf{GES} & \textbf{NOTEARS} & \textbf{COSMO}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & \textbf{0.9} & 53.4 & 10.5 & 6.4\\
    Sachs & \textbf{0.1} & 648.7 & 28.0 & 15.1\\
    Alarm & \textbf{23.9} & 1774.8 & 529.8 & 28.2\\
    Child & \textbf{27.3} & 758.5 & 263.1 & 14.8\\
    Insurance & \textbf{27.8} & 893.9 & 497.2 & 6.0\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

PC is the fastest algorithm on every dataset, completing in under 30 seconds even on
the largest networks.  GES is consistently the slowest, often by an order of magnitude or
more; on Alarm, it requires nearly half an hour.  NOTEARS occupies an intermediate
position, with runtimes ranging from 10 seconds to several minutes depending on network
size.  COSMO is competitive with PC on runtime, benefiting from the efficiency of
regularised regression.

Figure~\ref{fig:runtime} displays these results on a logarithmic scale, highlighting the
orders--of--magnitude differences between algorithms.  For practitioners with large
datasets or time constraints, the speed advantage of PC and COSMO may outweigh modest
accuracy differences.

  \caption{Runtime comparison across datasets (log scale).  PC and COSMO are
   consistently faster than GES and NOTEARS.}
  \label{fig:runtime}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Algorithm Summary.}
Figure~\ref{fig:radar} presents a radar chart summarising each algorithm's average
performance across five dimensions: skeleton $F_1$, directed $F_1$, precision, recall
and speed (normalised so that higher is better).  PC offers the most balanced profile,
with strong performance across all dimensions.  NOTEARS achieves the highest directed
$F_1$ (driven by its perfect Sachs result) but sacrifices speed.  GES lags on most
metrics and is particularly slow.  COSMO provides a fast alternative with moderate
accuracy.

\subsection{Detecting Analyst Mis--specification}

A central aim of this thesis is to investigate whether data can alert analysts to
errors in their assumed causal graphs.  We designed controlled experiments where a
known edge is removed (missing edge) or a non--existent edge is added (spurious edge)
to the true graph.  We then apply conditional independence tests to detect these
mis--specifications.

Table~\ref{tab:misspec_scenarios} lists the specific edges manipulated for each dataset.
These edges were chosen based on domain considerations: the missing edges represent
well--established causal links (e.g.\ Smoking $\to$ LungCancer in Asia), while the
spurious edges represent implausible connections (e.g.\ VisitAsia $\to$ Bronchitis).

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Mis--specification scenarios.  Missing edges are true causal links removed
   from the analyst's DAG; spurious edges are false links added.}
  \label{tab:misspec_scenarios}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Missing Edge} & \textbf{Spurious Edge}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & Smoking $\to$ LungCancer & VisitAsia $\to$ Bronchitis\\
    Sachs & PKA $\to$ Mek & PIP2 $\to$ PKA\\
    Alarm & PVSAT $\to$ SAO2 & KinkedTube $\to$ Intubation\\
    Child & Disease $\to$ LungParench & Age $\to$ Grunting\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Conditional Independence Testing.}
For each scenario, we computed a conditional independence test between the endpoint
variables, conditioning on appropriate parent sets.  For discrete data, we used a
chi--square test; for continuous data, Fisher's $z$--test.  Table~\ref{tab:ci_results}
reports the test statistics and $p$--values.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Conditional independence test results for mis--specification detection.
   Missing edges should show significant dependence (reject $H_0$); spurious edges
   should show non--significant results (fail to reject).}
  \label{tab:ci_results}
  \begin{tabular}{llccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Edge Type} & \textbf{Statistic} & \textbf{$p$--value} & \textbf{Reject $H_0$?}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & Missing & 83.2 & $7.3 \times 10^{-20}$ & Yes\\
    Asia & Spurious & 0.30 & 0.859 & No\\
    Sachs & Missing & 48.3 & $< 10^{-15}$ & Yes\\
    Sachs & Spurious & 1.35 & 0.177 & No\\
    Alarm & Missing & 578.0 & $< 10^{-100}$ & Yes\\
    Alarm & Spurious & 0.40 & 0.818 & No\\
    Child & Missing & 825.8 & $< 10^{-100}$ & Yes\\
    Child & Spurious & 25.5 & 0.001 & Yes*\\
    \bottomrule
    \multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize *Unexpected result due to confounding; see text.}
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results confirm that conditional independence tests effectively detect missing edges.
In all four datasets, the test statistic for the omitted edge is large and highly
significant ($p < 0.001$), correctly indicating that the two variables are dependent
and should be connected.  An analyst who omitted such an edge would receive a clear
signal to reconsider their DAG.

For spurious edges, the tests correctly identify three of the four as unnecessary.  The
statistics for Asia, Sachs and Alarm are small, with $p$--values well above the
conventional $\alpha = 0.05$ threshold.  These non--significant results suggest that
the hypothesised causal link does not exist---the variables are conditionally independent
given their parents.

The Child dataset presents an exception.  The spurious edge Age $\to$ Grunting yields
a significant test result ($\chi^2 = 25.5$, $p = 0.001$), suggesting dependence where
none should exist.  Investigation reveals that this arises from confounding: Age and
Grunting share a common cause (Disease) that induces a spurious association when not
properly conditioned upon.  This case illustrates a limitation of purely statistical
mis--specification checks: they assume the analyst has specified the correct conditioning
set.  If the DAG is sufficiently mis--specified, even spurious edges may appear
significant.

Figure~\ref{fig:ci_tests} visualises these results, contrasting the large test statistics
for missing edges with the (mostly) small statistics for spurious edges.

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/sensitivity_ci_tests.png}

   Left panel: missing edges (all significant, as expected).  Right panel: spurious
   edges (mostly non--significant, correctly identifying them as false).}
  \label{fig:ci_tests}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Algorithm Recovery of Omitted Edges.}
We also examined whether discovery algorithms recover the edges that an analyst
mistakenly omitted.  Table~\ref{tab:sensitivity_algos} reports performance when
algorithms are run on data generated from the true graph, compared against both the
true graph and the analyst's mis--specified graph.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Algorithm performance in sensitivity analysis (vs.\ true graph).}
  \label{tab:sensitivity_algos}
  \begin{tabular}{llccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{$F_1$} & \textbf{SHD}\\
    \midrule
    Asia & PC & 0.84 & 8\\
         & GES & 1.00 & 4\\
         & NOTEARS & 0.88 & 8\\
         & COSMO & 0.82 & 6\\
    \midrule
    Sachs & PC & 0.90 & 6\\
          & GES & 0.91 & 3\\
          & NOTEARS & 1.00 & 0\\
          & COSMO & 0.73 & 14\\
    \midrule
    Alarm & PC & 0.67 & 50\\
          & GES & 0.67 & 45\\
          & NOTEARS & 0.61 & 59\\
          & COSMO & 0.49 & 53\\
    \midrule
    Child & PC & 0.72 & 22\\
          & GES & 0.82 & 15\\
          & NOTEARS & 0.71 & 21\\
          & COSMO & 0.71 & 25\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Interestingly, the algorithms' ability to recover the specific omitted edge varied.
GES successfully recovered the Smoking $\to$ LungCancer edge on Asia, achieving
$F_1 = 1.00$.  NOTEARS perfectly recovered all edges on Sachs, including PKA $\to$ Mek.
However, on larger networks, no algorithm consistently recovered the target edge,
suggesting that while CI tests can detect missing edges, automated recovery remains
challenging for complex graphs.

Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivity_algos} compares algorithm performance in the sensitivity
analysis across datasets.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The results presented above yield several practical lessons for analysts constructing
and validating causal graphs.  We organise this discussion around four themes:
algorithm selection, the orientation challenge, mis--specification detection, and
limitations of the current study.

\subsection{Guidance on Algorithm Selection}

No single algorithm dominates across all conditions.  Practitioners should choose based
on data characteristics and computational constraints.

For \textbf{continuous data} satisfying approximate linear--Gaussian assumptions,
NOTEARS is the recommended choice.  Its perfect recovery on Sachs demonstrates the
power of continuous optimisation when model assumptions hold.  However, practitioners
should verify that their data approximate these assumptions; on discrete or highly
nonlinear data, NOTEARS may produce misleading results.

For \textbf{discrete data}, PC offers the best combination of accuracy and speed.  It
adapts automatically to discrete inputs via chi--square testing and runs quickly even
on large networks.  GES may achieve slightly higher recall in some cases but at
substantially greater computational cost and often lower precision.

When \textbf{computational resources are limited}, PC and COSMO provide fast alternatives.
Both complete in under 30 seconds on all benchmark networks, compared to minutes or
hours for GES.  The speed advantage compounds when running multiple bootstrap samples
or conducting sensitivity analyses.

For \textbf{exploratory analysis} where quick iteration matters more than optimal accuracy,
COSMO's stability--selection approach provides interpretable edge--frequency estimates
alongside the learned structure.  These frequencies can guide follow--up investigation
of uncertain edges.

\subsection{The Orientation Challenge}

Our results highlight a fundamental difficulty in causal discovery from observational
data: even when algorithms correctly identify which variables are directly related,
they frequently err on the direction of causation.  The gap between skeleton and
directed $F_1$ often exceeds 30 percentage points.

This challenge is not a failure of specific algorithms but a reflection of
identifiability limits.  Without v--structures, faithfulness violations, or additional
assumptions (equal error variances, non--Gaussianity), multiple DAGs may encode the
same conditional independence relations.  Algorithms can only recover the Markov
equivalence class, not the unique true DAG.

Practitioners should therefore interpret learned edge directions cautiously.  Where
domain knowledge provides clear causal ordering (e.g.\ temporal precedence, established
mechanisms), it should take precedence over algorithmically assigned orientations.
Combining automated discovery with expert review offers the most robust path to
accurate causal models.

\subsection{Detecting and Correcting Mis--specification}

Our sensitivity experiments demonstrate that conditional independence tests provide a
powerful tool for detecting analyst errors.  When a true causal link is omitted, the
resulting statistical dependence typically yields highly significant test results,
alerting the analyst to reconsider their assumptions.  Conversely, spurious edges often
produce non--significant results, suggesting they can be safely removed.

However, this approach has limitations.  The Child dataset example---where a spurious
edge appeared significant due to confounding---illustrates that CI tests assume correct
specification of conditioning sets.  If the DAG is substantially wrong, confounding can
induce spurious associations that masquerade as genuine effects.  Iterative refinement,
combining multiple tests with domain review, offers a more robust strategy than relying
on any single test.

Bootstrap edge stability provides a complementary diagnostic.  Edges that appear in a
high fraction of bootstrap samples are more credible than those with low stability.
When combined with CI testing, these techniques form a practical toolkit for model
criticism and refinement.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Several limitations temper the conclusions of this study.

First, we evaluated algorithms on \textbf{small to medium--sized benchmark networks}
(8--37 nodes).  Real--world causal discovery problems may involve hundreds or thousands
of variables, where computational constraints and statistical power become more acute.
Future work should evaluate scalability on larger graphs.

Second, our data--generating process assumes \textbf{no latent confounders, selection
bias, or measurement error}.  Real observational data routinely violate these
assumptions.  Extensions such as FCI (Fast Causal Inference) handle latent confounders
but were not included in this study.

Third, we considered only \textbf{four algorithms} from a much larger methodological
space.  Hybrid methods (MMHC), latent--variable approaches (FCI, RFCI), and deep--learning
techniques (GraN--DAG, NOTEARS--MLP) offer alternative trade--offs that merit evaluation.

Fourth, our sensitivity analysis examined \textbf{single--edge perturbations}.  Real
analyst errors may involve multiple mis--specified edges, compounding confounding effects
and complicating detection.  Multi--edge robustness studies would strengthen practical
guidance.

Finally, we focused on \textbf{structure learning from observational data}.  Incorporating
interventional data---experimental perturbations of specific variables---can dramatically
improve identifiability.  Future work should explore hybrid observational--interventional
designs.

Despite these limitations, the framework and experiments reported here provide a
foundation for rigorous benchmarking and practical guidance.  The \emph{CausalWhatNot}
codebase, released alongside this thesis, enables reproducible evaluation and extension
of our methods.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We developed a reproducible benchmarking framework that evaluates causal discovery
 algorithms on accepted toy networks and examined how analyst mis--specification can
 be detected.  The Asia, Sachs, ALARM and Child networks provide a useful testbed
 for comparing PC, GES, NOTEARS and COSMO.  Our mis--specification experiments
 show that conditional independence testing and bootstrap stability can notify
 practitioners when their assumed graphs are wrong.  We also surveyed a range of
 open--source DAG drawing and analysis tools to guide practitioners.  Future work will
 extend this study to larger networks, incorporate interventional data, and explore
 methods for integrating expert priors with automated discovery.
